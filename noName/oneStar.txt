Stay FAR AWAY- I went here for lunch recently and was extremely disappointed.
The food was absolutely horrible and extremely overpriced.  I ordered shrimp
cocktail which included 8 small pre-frozen shrimp and they charged $18. I also
had a lobster roll which was very very small. The plate was mostly filled with
fries, to cover the fact the lobster roll was so small-they charged a whopping
$30!!! üò≥ The calamari was rubbery and soggy as if it was reheated.  Overall
it was a terrible experience.  There are many other restaurants in the area
with much better seafood.  To top it off the restaurants decor is super
outdated and there is no view to speak of. I‚Äôd take the extra 5 minute walk to
Legal Seafood. Much better option.

This is not the best recommendation for the tourists who have a high
expectation on food-I wouldn't bring their guests here if I was a tour guide.
Honestly, we waited about almost an hours and half until we get seats but the
food weren't being served as fast as we expected even after we've got the
appetizers. As the others' comments, this place is only for the tourists and I
couldn't see any local people who visit this place. The fries were soggy, and
a cup of beer costs about 10 dollars. I live in the NYC, but I've never seen
this overpriced beer. I expected more high quality of beer taste since I
ordered the beer depite of the high prize, it also disappointed me.

Once upon a time,  this place was great.  I've been a patron since the early
60s. We'll over a thousand visits. The fish I assume is still fresh but
greasy,  smaller portions and the chowder to die for is now less than
adequate.  I believe I've said goodbye to the No Name

Terrible service, non friendly staff... food was mediocre, multiple items
listed on the menu that they did not serve anymore, and when we addressed it

We had gotten lost at the pier on the way there and called to make sure we
were at the right place. The person on the phone was extremely rude and
unhelpful, but we managed to find our way there. The food was okay; scallops
and seafood chowders were great, lobster was decent (and obviously pricey),
but the fish was mediocre at best. The hosts were very rude (I would assume
these were the same people on the phone) and snapped at us multiple times for
no reason (and even if there was a reason, yelling at us was unnecessary).
They didn't seem to care or attempt to apologize when they realized we did
nothing wrong. We didn't see the validation sign on our way in to park due to
the rain and fog, and were going to ask the hosts if we needed a validation,
but they were so rude and unapproachable, we didn't and ended up wasting $50
on parking for a 45 minute stay. If you want a decently priced meal and
acceptable service, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

My first time  and I was very disappointed, the food was tasteless and over

FYI to the cook it don't take long to fry sea food,  I'd rather wait then have
my food pre fryed and sitting  under warming lamps. I wont be back unless

This was such a poor excuse for a seafood restaurant in Boston- or anywhere on
the map for that matter! The service was quite odd as it seemed that the
server who was in the section we initially requested (water view) insisted
that it was too cold for us to sit on the patio, which is still inside and
heated. There were also other patrons out there. She warned that "you can't
move once your food starts coming so now's your chance," as if we had any
intentions of moving tables after specifically requesting that section. So we
decided to move simply because she had no desire to serve us. I really tried
to ignore that the visibly seen kitchen staff were sitting behind their half
wall on their phones with apparently nothing to do. Aside from that out of the
five in our party, only one person ate about half their food. The seafood was
not fresh at all. The scrod fish (said to be haddock??) had a grayish look
under the batter- not white as haddock should be. I chewed two SPOILED
SCALLOPS which sent me to the restroom gagging! I thought maybe the first
scallop was just a fluke when I spit it into my napkin, but the second one
sent me flying to the bathroom. My aunt said to the waiter that the food
tasted like poison (yes she's dramatic); then the server's response was "no
it's not poison because you can't serve poison at a restaurant. It may be bad
but it's not poison." What??? When whom I'd assume was the owner woke up from
his nap (seriously, he was asleep) at the front of the restaurant near the
hostess stand, he came to our table to hear our complaints. His response was
to put his finger dangerously close to my food and said " those scallops were
$10 per pound. They are not bad!! We served them all day and you are the only
one who complained!" Then proceeded to tell the waiter with his hand in the
air "just don't give them a bill" then just walked away shaking his head. The
server then reminded us not to forget to tip him in spite of the food since he
still served us. So he got a $12 despite his odd "service" of insulting us
when we asked was the food fresh by pointing out the window toward the water
and asked "come on, are you really asking me if the seafood is fresh?" This
experience was bizarre at best. Went to get pizza after leaving here. NEVER
would I EVER again!

Vacationing in the area, and saw this restaurant featured on the food network.
The staff was very friendly, however we went for the food, and that was pretty
bad. I had the seafood chowder, which was ok, nothing to brag about. I
definitely didn't leave wanting more... My husband had the broiled seafood
platter, no seasoning, overcooked, cold, and what may have once been a crust
on a fish from cooking, was more like tough edges from being left out and
reheated.  Definitely don't recommend, and will not go back. No good
impression made here!

Very little good  food and service  received for the large amount paid, right
@ $50.00.
Ordered Crab Cakes @$16.95 for 3 of the thinnest crab cakes ever; looked like
veggie something or the other. Taste was marginal. Ordered the Broiled Seafood
Platter; I travel the "Fruited Planes" throughout America quite
often  dining at many and various 4-5 star rated restaurants and in all these
years have never experienced such a "Royal rippoff"! The white fish was so
over cooked, honestly it was hard to cut with the knife they furnished. The
Cod was also overcooked so as to be dark in color;was not ordered blackened.
Furthermore the Salmon was quite "fishy" , meaning it wasn't fresh, possibly
frozen awhile. Here's the biggest problem, the person who waited on us never
returned to ask how the food was or for refills, but majored on rudeness
instead. 
These folks charged the full 18% gratuity, and gave no service, but "took the
pay"!
This No Name restaurant with be for me a "No
Return" restaurant.

I went to this restaurant for a birthday dinner. I use to go here many years
ago and loved it. I was so  unimpressed. the menu is limited, not at all like
the website. no clam chowder,[just seafood] no onion rings. You get coleslaw,
and French fries with all orders. I should have left but the waiter was
excellent, a older African American Man.  One of the people order the fried
oysters which were horrible, but it was taken off the bill.  The best dinner
was chicken fingers [in a seafood restaurant],we left this restaurant
disappointed and I felt bad because I recommended this restaurant. I will not
go back her again or recommend this restaurant to anyone. No name use to be
excellent but now I would not go back here again, even though the waiter was

The waiter tried to be nice but he smelled cigarettes and... let's just say I
don' want to falsly accuse anyone. Toasted bread that came first was dripping
oil/butter. Food was served fast. Clam chowder was ok. French fries-sogy.
Broiled fish-overcoked and also floating in grease; kind of tasteless. The
portion was small, especially considering the price.

ate 2 and almost vomited they were so gross- we felt bad so hid the rest of
them in our napkins....Idk how the other food is but whatever you do don't get
the mussels- all the other food looked blah and greasy and old. This place

Saw this restaurant on Food Paradise and when vacationing in Boston, my family
and I went there for dinner. Parking is at a premium in Boston, but they have
a parking lot and validates, so parking is free. The restaurant is close to
the pier and the scenery at twilight is stunning.
We were seated as soon as we enetered by a charismatic hostess who joked that
he would be giving us the best seat in the house. We were seated in the back
of the restaurant, by the window overlooking an old, seemingly abandoned ship
which blocks the view of the water.  The interior of the restaurant is very
dated, bordering on dilapidated. Our waiter, an older man came over, seeming
aloof and disconnected from evey aspect of customer service. He rambled
unintelligibly through his explanation of the menu. We ordered the fish soup
and it was delectably divine. The soups came before our drinks, which took an
inordiante amount of time to get to the table. The service was painfully slow
and the food, mediocre at best.  Even worst was the service!  We waited for
long periods of time to see our waiter for refills on the children's sodas or
our drinks. My husband had to leave the table to find him congregating with
other staff at a table. He reluctantly brought over the drinks, never
inquiring if we enjoyed our meal, needed napkins or anything else, or even
apologize for being a negligent waiter. Needless to say his poor service was
reflected in his meager tip.

I do not recommend this restaurant. I came here on a busy Saturday night. I
got the Seafood Platter with shrimp, calamari, scallops, swordfish and
vegetables. Everything was overcooked. Like it had been sitting in a pan all
evening. I didn't even eat half of it. Everyone I dined with did not like the
food and complained of being nautious afterwards. When our waitress saw I
didn't eat my food, she deducted the meal from our bill. I will never eat
there again.
 To be fair, the garlic bread and fries were very good, and we were given a
generous amount of bread and slaw. The waitress was nice and tried her best to
accommodate our disappointment. 
The menu is also lacking in options and the prices are higher than they should
be.

The worst seafood we've ever had.  Make sure the waiter brings you water. He
probably won't.  Whatever seafood you order will be hard to swallow and
possibly too far down to spit out.     Rubbery lobster - like big, plump,
lobster colored rubber bands.  Like a dog toy at CVS.  I ordered the broiled
seafood platter because I wanted lots of variety because we had looked forward
to going there.  They brought ‚Äì eventually brought‚Äì tiny dry oysters, scallops
stuck to the plate, rubber shrimp.  I think I got a scrod-flavored pork chop.
Go there for entertainment value.  You'll talk about how bad it for months.
The Sam Adams Lager isn't dry.  I recommend it instead of water.

I visited there by the travel agent's bus so there was no other choice. The
small ~1lb Lobster costs $28 dollars and it was rotten, we asked the waiter to
change, he immediately replaced it with a freshly steamed lobster without a
question - which made me think it probably has happened several times before.
I cannot imagine a seafood restaurant next to the sea port with large volume
of guests would have rotten lobster in stock and the cook could not tell.The
crab cake was so salty I could not finish it, I complained to waiter, he just
said "I'm sorry". Also watch out - the New England Chowder was just "fish
chowder", not "clam chowder", all of us in the trip ordered it thinking it was
"New England Clam Chowder".

A BOWL OF BUTTER
My family recently all came in to town for a reunion. There was 36 of us Who
were originally all from the Boston area at one time or another and love their
sea food and chowder! 
Well I have NEWS for you and it isn't GOOD NEWS. Out of all 36 meals there was
only two meals that were with out complaints. That's not GOOD..
The chowder was a bowl of butter, the lobsters were all dried out the fried
food was cooked in old oil which altered the taste of the food. So we all eat
the bread! 
To end on a better note, the wait staff did an excellent job with the service
with a smile!

Gross about sums it up, really dirty, and the food was terrible. The only
thing it has going for it is you get a lot of food but you will not want to
eat it. The chowder is like milk with sardines in it. The cabbies and people
around town all get discounts to recommend it. Don't fall for it. Legal
Seafood is the way to go.

Ashante, thanks so much for taking the time to share your feedback about your
recent visit. We strive to provide all of our guests with quick, friendly, and
attentive service, and it's clear that we missed the mark here. While we wish
you would have brought this incident to the attention of a manager so we could
have assisted you while you were still dining with us, we thank you for
bringing it to light now so we can avoid a similar experience in the future.

Friendly and service minded waiter, but the rest was "quick". "Get as mutch
food on the table as quick as possible"- kind of feeling....:(

I liked absolutely nothing about this place. This was my second visit and I
wanted to take my girlfriend with me. The food was terrible and the fish
tasted way too dry and over cooked. My stomach was messed up for hours. The
coleslaw was bland beyond belief. Not that many menu options. Couldnt wait to
leave, and to top it off the $50.00 parking was unacceptable. Called about the
parking and was told it was "my fault" for not getting my ticket validated.
Wouldnt even help me work this out and talked to with such disrespect and
attitude. Felt unwelcomed since we stepped foot in the door.  Never again will
I spend money in this establishment. Wouldnt even reccomend it to my enemy.
The only good thing I had there was the bread.

Got scombroid (see Wikipedia) from their bluefish and spent the day on an IV
in urgent care.  Apparently you can't get fresh fish even on the fishing pier.
You would expect a restaurant serving fish for their entire existence would
know proper handling to prevent foodborne illness.  Thanks for the medical
bills No Name!

In the last 20 years I have rarely left food on my plate. The sea food platter
was served on a disgusting dirty metal tray, the sword fish was disgusting,
left 3/4 of it, the 2 shrimp were fresh and good, the cowl-slaw was tasteless,
the rice was cold and anything but tasty. I will never be back, nor ever
recommend it to anyone.

Terrible food. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant where I refused to
eat my food, but yeah... It happened. My friend and I got fried clams and the
consistency was like hot, pasty, bay water, with bits of shell or sand in
them. Terrible. Praying they don't charge me the $20 price on the menu

The food was gross, the tables were sticky, the waitstaff was the rudest group
of incompetents I've ever seen... sure it's a hole in the wall, so if you're
looking for a cute waste of time with no class whatsoever, this is your joint.

from the tartar sauce which was pretty much relish to the bland tasteless
coleslaw I was not impressed by anything I ate . The shrimp was the only thing
i enjoyed in my seafood platter .  And I am born and raised in  The city of
Boston and this was sub par seafood at best .  I can say that the other two
people in my party also agreed. The service went along with the food .

Avoid at all costs.  Hugely overpriced flavorless food served up by charmless
hosts in an industrial space.   Everything is room temperature.
