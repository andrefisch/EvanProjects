Profile
Founded on 15 November 1899, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, better
known as ClassNK or simply NK, is a ship classification society
dedicated to safeguarding life and property at sea and to protecting the marine environment. ClassNK provides broad spectrum of
services as an independent third party, non-profit organization,
including survey & certification services, technical consulting services, and research & development activities. The principal work
of the Society’s expert technical staff is to conduct surveys of new
and existing ships and other floating structures, including hull

structures, propulsion systems, electrical and electronic systems,
safety equipment, and cargo handling gear, among numerous
other areas, to ensure their full compliance with classification rules
developed by the Society. ClassNK also conducts a wide range of
statutory surveys on behalf of more than 100 flag States around
the world, as well as audits and registers ship safety & security
management systems, quality, environmental and occupational
health management systems, and seafarer training institutions.

Code of Ethics
In accordance with its mission to ensure the safety of life and property
at sea and prevent the pollution of the marine environment, ClassNK
has a duty to conduct its activities not only with respect for life and
in observation of the law, but in accordance with social norms and
commonly held principles. Bearing this in mind, ClassNK hereby
established the following Code of Ethics.
1. The Mission of the Society
In order to fulfill its mission of ensuring the safety of life and property
at sea and the security of ships, and preventing the pollution of the
marine environment, as well as to provide clients with the best possible service, ClassNK shall operate in accordance with its Rules, as
well as relevant international conventions, statutory regulations, flag
administration requirements and other applicable standards.
The Society shall also make every effort to establish an organized
system for conducting business, and shall strive not only to maintain
that system, but to make continual improvements to that system in
order to earn and maintain the trust of its customers and the society
at large.

4. Implementation of Classification and Statutory Surveys
ClassNK shall conduct all surveys fairly and impartially and in strict
accordance with the Rules of the Society and the requirements of the
flag administration. ClassNK shall not issue classification and statutory
certificates and or other certificates or survey records, and shall not
endorse such certificates, without performing the required surveys
and/or fulfilling other stipulated requirements, accordingly.
5. Observance of Laws
ClassNK recognizes that it has a duty to society at large and shall
execute all of its activities with respect to justice and impartiality, and
shall strictly observe the law and social standards.
The management of ClassNK therefore recognize adherence to this
Code of Ethics as part of the Society’s mission, and shall not only
ensure that all members of the Society’s staff are made familiar with
this Code, but shall also establish a system to ensure its effective
application.
Further, in the event of a serious violation of this Code or the law, the
management of ClassNK recognizes that it has the responsibility to
investigate the cause of the violation and to take timely and appropriate corrective action in order to prevent the reoccurrence of such
violations in the future.

ClassNK Annual Report

2. Independence, Impartiality and Integrity
ClassNK shall maintain its status as an independent organization and
provide its services as an impartial third party.
All personnel of the Society shall work so as to bring neither disgrace
to the Society’s honor nor detriment to the Society’s interests. Further,
personnel of the Society shall not take action in the name of the
Society, nor make use of their official title, except in the pursuit of
their official duties. All personnel of the Society shall remain free from
any commercial, financial and other pressures which may affect their
judgement on surveys and audits.

3. Confidentiality of Information
ClassNK shall recognize all certificates and survey records issued by
the Society, as well as all relevant survey documents submitted by
customers and all such information obtained by the Society as confidential information, and the contents and copies of such documents
shall not be made available to other parties except as defined in the
Rules of the Society, required by applicable legislation, court order,

Message from Chairman and President
2016 at a Glance

2016 ushered in some major changes worldwide, from the referendum on leaving the European Union in the United Kingdom to
the surprising election results in the United States.

Organization List
ClassNK Annual Report

For our core surveying and auditing services, a more efficient service network has been put in place and new expertise hired to
ensure the quality of our services and best service our customers’
needs.

The Society will earnestly continue to deliver the very best technical services to its clients and continue to maintain and strengthen
relations of trust with the industry. We look forward to receiving
your valued support for our activities in 2017.

International Affairs

Following my appointment as Chairman and President of ClassNK
last in March 2016, I reassessed our corporate governance structure and made some organizational changes in order to better
secure the Society and ensure the continuance and development
of our services under these more challenging market conditions.

As the demand for third-party certification services has also
grown, ClassNK is also working to expand its certification services
for quality, environmental and occupational health and safety systems as well as for maritime education and training, greenhouse
gas emissions and renewable energy generation technologies.
The Society has been particularly proactive in renewable energy,
issuing certification for various onshore large wind turbines in
2016.

Research

In light of the current situation, this has placed our organization
under more financial pressure. However, our priority remains to
offer the best technical services to each of our clients under our
mission of ensuring the safety of life and property at sea and
protecting the marine environment. Taking these financial circumstances and the latest regulatory trends into consideration,
we intend to work even harder in order to further develop our
core classification services and make valued contributions to the
industry.

We have also made big commitments in the fields of Big Data
and the Internet of Things, where we are working on providing
the necessary platforms and mechanisms for data exchange in
addition to ensuring cybersecurity so that the maritime industry
can reap the biggest rewards from this exciting new opportunity.
Last year our wholly owned subsidiary Ship Data Center, an
information hub for ship data, began operations. Our machinery maintenance management software suite ClassNK CMAXS
was also awarded for its contributions to Big Data when it was
awarded the Big Data Award at the Lloyd’s List Award last year.
The fully IMO GBS compliant ClassNK Archive Center began
operations in 2016 and ClassNK e-Certificate, the world’s first
comprehensive system to provide ship class certificates and statutory certificates issued on behalf of flag states in electronic format
began operational trials.

Action

While we are seeing some recovery in the maritime industry, it
is yet to be seen whether these are the early manifestations of
full recovery. An income of regulatory changes over the past year
such as the triggering of entry into force of the Ballast Water
Management Convention and the Panama’s accession to ratification of the Hong Kong Convention on ship recycling, are all
expected to have a significant impact on the maritime industry
as well as the shipbuilding and shipping industries and of course,
classification societies.
The decision at the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC70) to further lower the cap on SOx emissions will
be another big turning point for the industry.

We also continue to make available our information services
such as publishing rule amendments or abolitions and guidelines
based on the latest R&D results, damage investigations, industry demands and revisions to international regulation made at
IMO or IACS, in addition to our comprehensive range of software
services.

Service Network

Amongst uncertainties surrounding the global state of affairs and
the world economy, it is even more important that we define our
policies and steer the organization in the right direction.

Furthermore we have also reformed our research institute and
have are continuing with activities related to research in ship classification that involve both research development and members
of the maritime industry.

Organization Profile

Welcome to the ClassNK Annual Report. First I would like to
extend my deepest appreciation to all of our clients and stakeholders who supported our activities throughout 2016.

ClassNK gains USCG authorization under ACP
The ACP was developed as an alternative
method for US-flagged vessels to fulfill
the regulatory requirements for construction and operation. In accordance with
USCG requirements, US-flagged vessels
are required to undergo onboard inspections by the USCG before a Certificate of
Inspection (COI) can be issued. Under the

ACP however, the USCG can issue a COI
to a ClassNK-registered, US-flagged vessel
based on reports from ClassNK without
the need for duplicate inspections. This
eases the financial and regulatory burden
on shipowners whilst maintaining existing
levels of safety.

Apr.
ShipDC operation commences operations
The wholly owned subsidiary set up by
ClassNK, Ship Data Center Co., Ltd.
(ShipDC), officially commenced operations of its data center as the platform for
maritime Big Data. After successful data
transfer trials from ship to shore, ShipDC

began operations. Voyage data from vessels of multiple shipping companies have
been continuously gathered and the data
has already been practically applied for
voyage data monitoring by cargo owners
and hull structure stress monitoring.

NKAC marked industry’s first system complying with IMO GBS
IMO GBS requires a Ship Construction File
(SCF) to be kept onboard during operation
for applicable ships. As the SCF includes
the documents recognized as being highly

ClassNK
in Action

The ClassNK register saw the addition of 653 vessels totaling 17,215,564
gross tons during the period of 2016.
Going beyond traditional classification services, ClassNK is proactively responding to the needs of the industry through a range of technical services,
certification services, renewable energy certification, and training.

Establishment and Amendment of
Technical Rules
ClassNK is constantly revising its Rules and Guidance in order to
reflect the latest results from relevant research and development
projects, feedback from damage investigations, correspond to
requests from industry as well as changes made to relevant international conventions, International Association of Classification
Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements (URs), national regulations,
etc. A total of 88 amendments were approved during 2016. This
report will introduce some of the major amendments.

Establishment and Amendments related to Gas Fueled Ships
Responding the expectation to gas fueled ships as the measures
to comply with regulations for ships’ emission such as GHG, NOx,
SOx, and Particulate Matter, the International Code of Safety
for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code)
was adopted during sessions of MSC95 and entered into force.
ClassNK established Part GF of the Rules and Guidance and
amended the relative rules and guidance in accordance with the

IGF code. The Part GF stipulates requirements for fuel containment system, material and general pipe design, bunkering, fuel
supply system, fire safety, ventilation, electrical installations, and
so on, of ships using gases or other low-flashpoint fuels. Furthermore, requirements for approving equipment and fittings of ships
using low-flashpoint fuels are provided as the annex to Part GF
of the Guidance.

Amendments related to Polar Code
Diminishing ice in Arctic and Antarctic areas due to global warming has drawn attention to voyaging waters surrounding the two
poles. Aiming the safety and the protection of the environments
around the two poles, the International Code for Ships Operating
in Polar Waters (Polar Code) and related amendments have been
adopted during the sessions of both MSC94 and MEPC68.

ClassNK amended its rules and guidance to stipulate requirements for ship structure, stability, water tightness, machinery,
fire safety, communications, structure and installation for environmental protection, and The Polar Water Operational Manual
provided for the ships.

ClassNK
in Research

In order to fulfill its mission of protecting life, property at sea and the maritime environment, and contribute to the maritime industry, ClassNK carries
out R&D related to classification as well as activities based on our role as a
member of the maritime community.

Research and Development
related to Classification
ClassNK has carried out R&D related to the classification societies
with the aim of improving rules and guidelines and expanding
technical services. The outlines of the main R&D carried out in
2016 are as follows:

Development of Rules for Structural Strength
of Large Container Ships
Following the development of the rules on the hull girder ultimate strength of large container ships considering the effects of
the lateral loads and the whipping response (a type of vibratory
responses caused by wave impact load) in 2015, research on hull
girder torsional strength were carried out in 2016 and the relevant rules were amended. The new amendments have made it
possible to evaluate the correlation of hull girder vertical bending,
horizontal bending and torsional bending more exactly on large
container ships with various structural arrangements.

Guidelines for Liquefied Gas Carriers Hull Structures –
Independent Spherical Tanks of Type B
“Guidelines for Liquefied Gas Carriers Hull Structures – Independent Spherical Tanks of Type B” were developed based on the
knowledge gained through the researches for the development of
rules and guidelines related to the structural strength.
The guidelines consist of “Guidelines for Direct Strength Analysis” and “Guidelines for Fatigue Strength Assessment”, which are
useful to make adequate hull structural strength assessment of
liquefied gas carriers with independent spherical tanks of type B.

Organization Profile

GUIDELINES FOR RACKING
STRENGTH ASSESSMENT OF
VEHICLES CARRIERS (GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF
YIELDING STRENGTH)

Service Network

Vehicles carriers are designed with minimum numbers of transverse and partial bulkheads in order to efficiently load/unload
cargo vehicles and to maximize the cargo loading capacity.
Due to such a structural feature, structural strength assessment
against racking deformations is one of the most important issues
for vehicles carriers.
Recently, new designed vehicles carriers, e.g. post panamax type
and bulkheadless type, which have different structural designs
from conventional vehicles carriers have appeared.
Considering such a situation, researches were carried out aiming to develop unified evaluation procedures on racking strength
for vehicles carriers with various structural design types, and the
guidelines for racking strength assessment of vehicles carriers (for
evaluation of yielding strength) were developed and published.

Action

ClassNK provides financial and technical support for academic
institutes and organizations conducting R&D in addition to collaborating with such organizations in various R&D projects.

carry out the bearing damage test and
prove the technology. This is not a spectral
analysis method which was mainstream in
the state diagnosis of slide bearings, but
a high precision state diagnosis method
by cepstrum analysis method. Even when
installing the sensor, special jigs and drilling work are unnecessary and versatility is
high, so it can be expected not only for
main bearing but also for other slide bearings (supercharger, propeller bearing etc.).
